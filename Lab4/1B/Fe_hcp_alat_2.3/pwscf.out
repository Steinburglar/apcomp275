     the Fermi energy is    17.7707 ev

!    total energy              =    -111.53926239 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000003 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00042887 Ry
     internal energy E=F+TS    =    -111.53969126 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =      24.19138237 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      10.67042918 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -52.92522646 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -93.47627636 Ry

     total magnetization       =     0.00 Bohr mag/cell
     absolute magnetization    =     0.01 Bohr mag/cell

     convergence has been achieved in  23 iterations

     Forces acting on atoms (cartesian axes, Ry/au):

     atom    1 type  1   force =     0.00000000    0.00000296    0.00000000
     atom    2 type  1   force =     0.00000000   -0.00000296    0.00000000

     Total force =     0.000004     Total SCF correction =     0.000001
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values
